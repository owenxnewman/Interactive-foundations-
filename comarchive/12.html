			After receiving thousands of emails from parents and children across America who did not have a safe, legal place to skate and in some cases arrested for skating on public property, Tony Hawk decided to establish a nonprofit organization whose mission would be to serve this population. He wanted to help them develop quality places to practice the sport that gives them much needed exercise and a sense of self-esteem. So in 2002 he established the Tony Hawk Foundation, financed the organization with a personal gift, and assembled a Board of Directors that represents a diverse range of backgrounds and expertise. In 2020, the organization changed its name to The Skatepark Project to more closely reflect the work it does.

			Since its inception, The Skatepark Project has been helping underserved communities create safe and inclusive public skateparks for youth.The organization favors projects that have strong community involvement, grassroots fundraising, and a base of support from the skaters, parents, law enforcement, and local leaders.

			In recent years, hundreds of municipalities have come to embrace the recreational—and societal—benefits of skateboard parks. With the popularity of skateboarding fueling the rush to build them, the need for help from The Skatepark Project has become more urgent and critical. Most cities in the process of building a public skatepark are working on their first, and for them there is no precedent, no blueprint. Once the cement is poured and formed, there is no changing it. All the right questions must be addressed before that step. The Skatepark Project was established to help cities develop that checklist and ensure that the hard work of skaters, parents, and city officials will result in a quality skatepark that will serve that community for years to come. The organization also supports International programs, like Skateistan, that enrich the lives of youth through skateboarding.

			Since 2002 The Skatepark Project has been fulfilling its mission to help young people by issuing grants to low-income communities building quality public skateparks, and providing guidance to city officials, parents, and children through the process. To-date, the foundation has awarded over $10-million to more than 600 public skatepark projects in all 50 States, and $150,000 to support the Skateistan program in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and South Africa.

			To-date, 575 recipients of The Skatepark Project grants have opened their skateparks. These parks receive more than 6-million visits annually by youth who benefit from the active lifestyle and camaraderie the facilities promote.

			The Skatepark Project supports disadvantaged communities and at-risk children. We are the only national grant-writing organization focused solely on the development and financing of free, quality public skateparks. We know that skateparks provide a safe and inspiring avenue for skaters to practice and excel at their sport, and the process of developing their local skatepark encourages and teaches young people about how to make positive changes within their own communities.

			The Skatepark Project has been working with municipalities and community groups to help them realize their dream of a quality public skatepark in their community. For Tony Hawk, the organization’s Founder, skateboarding was a healthy outlet and a recreational challenge, and it provided a social group of creative, like-minded individuals. It’s also a sport that helped him build confidence, taught him to persevere, and through his mentoring of younger skaters helped him develop leadership skills. The Skatepark Project works every day to be able to bring these same lessons to youth around the world.

			Public skateparks all start the same way; community interest in a new place to skate grows until some people do something about it. The skatepark team considers the most viable path to a new skatepark. As one of their first acts, the new team introduces the skatepark idea to local government. The group works with the city to confront challenges, answer questions, and meet requirements along the way. 

			Coordinating with the city, the team solicits support for the new public park from lots of people and organizations. The advocacy team keeps the public and stakeholders informed, sets the project’s pace, and coordinates with the city to garner support from different people, groups, and institutions.

		</p>

		<p>

			Every public skatepark in the United States is built with direct involvement and support from the local skateboarding community. Large or small, city or country, poor or wealthy, one thing is always true: volunteers get skateparks built. 

			It is encouraging to remember that thousands of successful public skateparks across the United States are open today, representing all kinds of communities and economic conditions. People that appreciate outdoor recreation everywhere see their skatepark as a reflection of their community’s commitment to physical and social health.
 
			Skatepark teams are usually a small group that does most of the work and a larger group of volunteers that show up when they’re needed.

			For people interested in starting a public skatepark project, there are two initial steps:

<h3> Step One: Form a Team </h3>

		<p>

			A skatepark advocacy group tends to start with a few people that wish there was a better or closer place to skate in their community. The team should publicize their meetings to invite others to lend their time and skills to the skatepark project. These team meetings are informal, compared to a city council meeting, and are usually held at someone’s home, public building, or local skate shop. The team should focus on understanding the development process and identifying areas that the group will probably be involved.

		</p>

		<p>

			The earliest team meetings are likely to be spent talking about the following topics:

		</p>

		<p>

			What is the long-term goal?

		</p>

		<p>

			What are the short-term goals, and what can we be doing now?

		</p>

			<p>What people, organizations, and agencies should be informed about the skatepark project?</p>

			<p>What are some of the benefits of public skateparks?</p>

			<p>What are reasonable recommendations for size, costs, and location?</p>

			<p>What are some effective fundraising models and strategies?</p>

			<p>Who will commit to doing what before the next meeting?</p>

			<p>The group composition and its activities will vary from project to project. Community characteristics, like size or economy, can have a major impact on the project’s viable strategies or  activities. It may be easier to gain approvals for the skatepark in a small town than in a major city, for example, but then easier to raise funds in a city than in a small town. Advocates spend a lot of time considering what particular opportunities exist in their areas.</p>

			<p>
			Skatepark groups that meet frequently – twice a month or more – and that are pursuing specific short-term goals tend to be more efficient than those that meet less often.
			</p>
 
			<p>

			Proposing a new skatepark to local government is the best way to launch this exciting partnership.

<h3>Step Two: Introduce the Project</h3>

<div class="leftsteps"></div> 


		<p>

			After a few team meetings around the goal for a new local skatepark, the advocacy group will  solicit interest and support from local government and, later, the general public, local businesses, and other area organizations. Starting with the city or parks department will provide valuable insight to your group’s strategy in obtaining necessary approvals and funds for the skatepark. Public city council or parks commission meeting times are available on the municipal website. 

 		</p>

 		<p>

			Introducing a skatepark concept to local government is, to some, a daunting task. The skatepark proposal is usually a short “speech” that lasts less than two minutes and describes a few of the key benefits that the new facility will bring. This will provide the starting point for many conversations that the team will be having with local government and others.

 		</p> 

 		<p>
			The team will seek more support from the city for site approval, funding assistance, hiring professional services, and navigating the development process. The team will also be stoking public interest for the skatepark by engaging the community in different, creative ways. Also, the team will seek technical and financial support from the general public, skate community, local businesses, and area organizations.

		<p> 	

			Experienced advocates recommend:
			Monthly (or more) skatepark meetings to inform and engage, promote the group’s goals, share recent achievements, and solicit support for upcoming events
			Establish short-term goals that help with the project’s skatepark mission
			Prepare to solicit support, guidance, and collaboration from local government
			Focus on expressing a positive, upbeat outlook; emphasize opportunities and activities that can be helpful today
			Expect to conduct a sustained and organized effort that may require several years to complete

<h4>- ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY -</h4>

			

	<p>
			The Skatepark Project believes every skatepark is the result of a partnership between youth, government, and local civic organizations. In spite of their rough edges, skateboarding youth often prove to be incredible advocates for the things that are important to them, and the long process of skatepark development is transformative not just for the skateboarders, but for the agencies and individuals who work with them. Our Skatepark Development Guide will lead you in the right direction.

  	</p>

		
<h4>- KIDS DESERVE A PLACE TO GROW -</h4>

  	<p>			

			Skateparks build and sustain healthy communities. As a gathering place for dedicated, athletic youth, the skatepark provides the forum for visitors young and old, beginning and skilled, to meet and share experiences. For many skateboarding youth, the skatepark becomes a home-away-from-home.

  	</p>

  			

<h4>- SENSE OF BELONGING -</h4>


  		<p>			

			More than anyone, young people need to feel like they are recognized and appreciated by their communities. In too many places skateboarders get the wrong message from local authorities who limit or outlaw skateboarding and ignore its inherent benefits. Skateparks are the solution. Every skatepark supports hundreds of kids that might otherwise have nowhere to go.

<h4>What are some of the community benefits of skateparks?</h4>


		<p> 

			There are too many benefits of skateparks to list in one place. There are the social benefits of providing a facility for young people, and particularly at-risk youth, to pursue an athletic activity that they love. There are public health benefits to having a safe place for young people to develop active lifestyles away from the risks found in the streets.

		</p>

<h4>Can the The Skatepark Project build a skatepark in my town?</h4>

		<p>
			Skateparks take a lot of resources and planning before they can be built. The Skatepark Project can’t come to your town and build you a skatepark, but we can help you get things moving and provide guidance and possibly some funding along the way. As a local, you’ll be expected to prepare your town for the skatepark by organizing an advocacy group, promoting the need for a skatepark to fellow citizens, getting approvals from local leaders, and giving local skaters a voice in the process. We can help you do those things, but you need to understand that you’ll be doing the local work.

		</p>

<h4>How do we begin our new skatepark project?</h4>


		<p> 
			There are lots of things you can do today to begin your skatepark. It will require lots of effort, but every skatepark that exists today has a person behind it that was willing to accept the challenge. The first thing you’ll need to do is to talk about the idea with your friends and family. Everyone will have ideas about where to begin, and you’ll pick up some valuable advice.

		</p> 

		<p>
			One of your first official acts will be to attend your local City Council meeting (or Parks Board meeting) and bring up the idea of a new skatepark. Though it’s likely that you will hear several reasons why a skatepark is impractical, stay focused on asking those questions that will reveal how those obstacles can be overcome. For example, if the City responds to the idea by stating that there’s no money for a skatepark right now, you might ask if there’s a way that the money could be raised by the skateboarding community with the City’s assistance.

		</p>

		<p>	
			In partnership with the International Association of Skateboard Companies and Skaters for Public Skateparks, The Skatepark Project has published the Public Skatepark Development Guide. This advocacy tool has been helping advocates navigate the skatepark-development process, and has been expanded as an interactive Web resource. Many skatepark groups credit the PSDG as their single-most-important source of guidance and data.

<h4>What do we do when we’ve asked for a skatepark and the city says no or that they can’t afford it?</h4>

		<p>

			Budgets are tight everywhere and it is common to hear reasons why a new skatepark isn’t possible. This doesn’t mean the skatepark won’t happen. It just means that there’s still more work to do. We can help you come up with ideas that address the challenges your skatepark project is facing.

		<p/>

		<p>

			Skateparks are the result of diverse partnerships between government and community groups. You will need to earn strong public support for the skatepark. This support will attract local businesses. Eventually, the skatepark will show signs of widespread popular support, and your local government will then find ways to work with your group to see the project through to completion.

		<p/>

<h4>We’ve been asking for a skatepark and nothing happens. What should we do differently?</h4>

		<p>

			Turn your attention away from local government and focus on building public support through events and partnerships with other community organizations. Rallying the public in support of the new park will present a popular project to your city government. When you reach out to your neighbors and people you meet on the street, consider having a small flyer with specific instructions to contact your city council, the link to your online petition, or towards whatever method you’re using to demonstrate support. It can also be useful to identify a supportive individual within city government that can help you identify key individuals and opportunities.

		<p/>

<h4>How do we create a nonprofit organization (and do we need to)?</h4>

		<p>

			If you are pursuing a single skatepark and have no intention to engage in fundraising after the park is open (skate classes or maintenance, for example), then there is little reason to launch an independent nonprofit organization. Instead, establish a partnership with another local nonprofit that can provide nonprofit status to your effort. You will essentially be fundraising on behalf of this organization, and they will be acting as your group’s “fiscal sponsor.” This is a common practice in skatepark projects.
