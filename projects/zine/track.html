<h1> 1994 Ferrari F40 LM </h1>

<p>The Ferrari F40 is a classic body style from Ferrari—a mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports car that was built between 1987 and 1992. The F40 was the successor to the Ferrari 288 GTO, designed to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary. It was the last car design personally approved by the late, great Enzo Ferrari. It was also Ferrari’s fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car at the time, with a suggested retail price of $400,000 (around $860,000 today), a twin-turbocharged V8 giving it 471 hp giving it a top speed of 199 mph. One of the original 1,311 produced sold to Formula One driver Nigel Mansell in 1990 for £1 million, a record that held until the 2010s.
</p>

<p>Of the 1,311 F40s made, only 19 of them were F40 LMs, according to Sotheby’s. According to GTSpirit, a 1994 F40 LM was expected to sell for between $2-$2.5 million, but it ended up going for $3.3 million. The F40 LM was featured in a number of races, debuting at the 1989 Laguna Seca Raceway in the GTO category. In 1995 the car won the 4 Hours of Anderstorp race, but then retired in 1996 after it wasn’t competitive against the newly-entered McLaren F1 GTR.
</p>

<h1> Porsche 550 Spyder </h1>

<p> The Porsche 550 Spyder was a super popular race car produced between 1953 and 1956. Only 90 of these cars were made, and of course, a lot less have survived into the modern era. An all-aluminum 1.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine known as the “Fuhrmann Engine” powered the car, producing 110 hp. The car was inspired by the Porsche 356, built by Ferry Porsche, as well as other Spyder prototypes built and raced by Walter Glöckler.
The 550 was built low to the ground to make it a sufficient race car, and this was demonstrated when Formula One racer Hans Hermann drove a 550 under closed railroad gates during the 1954 Mille Miglia.
</p>

<p>The 550 Spyder was both a track and road car. It was almost always in winning positions (top three spots) during races. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld owned one that was sold alongside 16 other cars (14 other Porsches) recently for $22 million. This car alone sold for $5,335,000. But another model was sold at a Bonhams Goodwood Revival Sale for $6 million. Both of these sales make it one of the most expensive Porsches ever sold. It’s estimated that only 46 or fewer 550 Spyders still exist today.
</p>

<p>The Ford GT40 is the original high-performance race car that was the precursor to the now-popular Ford GT supercar. The GT40 was based on the British Lola Mk6 and was powered by a series of American-made engines built solely for the car. The GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans four consecutive times, from 1966 to 1969, and finished 1-2-3 in 1966. With Henry Ford II in attendance at Le Mans, the Mk II GT40 gave Ford the first Le Mans victory for an American manufacturer in 1966.
</p>

<p>
The car was produced to win long-distance races, primarily against Ferrari, who won Le Mans six times in a row from 1960 to 1965. As you can see, Ford succeeded in their one-sighted mission.
The car was named after its style, a Grand Tourer, and its overall height of 40 inches. Only 105 of these cars were produced between 1964 and 1969. They all ran on different sized V8 engines, including a 4.7-liter engine in the Mk I, a 7.0-liter FE engine in the MK II (the same engine that got them the 1-2-3 finish in 1966), a detuned, 306-hp 4.7-liter engine in Mk III, and the same engine in Mk IV as in Mk II. These cars are extremely rare and valuable these days, as a prototype GT40 was sold in 2014 for $7 million, according to Hemmings.
</p>

<p>The Porsche 917 is a sports car prototype that is famous for a few reasons. First, it gave Porsche its first overall wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1970 and 1971. Second, it was featured in the Steve McQueen film Le Mans. In 2017, the car driven by McQueen in the film sold at auction for $14 million, which was a record price for Porsche.
</p>

<p>
The car was powered by a Type 912 flat-12 engine of 4.5, 4.9, or 5 liters, and was capable of reaching 0-62 mph in just 2.3 seconds, and with a test track top speed of 240 mph.
</p>

<p>he Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato was unveiled at the 1960 London Motor Show as a lightened, improved version of the standard DB4 GT. It was improved at the Zagato factory in Italy, where the car was expected to have a run of 25 units, but ended up ceasing production on the 20th. The car has a popular history, which has resulted in two subsequent cars being named “Zagatos,” both based on the DB4. Zagato is one of the world’s most well-known coachbuilders. They’ve been around since 1919 and have designed some of the most memorable cars, including this one.
The car was powered by a 3.7-liter twin-spark straight-six engine that produced 314 hp, had a 0-60 acceleration time of 6.1 seconds, and a top speed of 154 mph. All of the steel components of the DB4 were replaced on this car with aluminum, making it smaller, more aerodynamic, and 100 pounds lighter. One of the originals recently sold at auction for $14.3 million.
</p>

<p>The Aston Martin DBR1 was a race car built in 1956 and intended for the World Sportscar Championship. Its most famous victory on the track came at the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans, which was Aston Martin’s only outright victory at the endurance race. It’s one of only three cars to win both the Le Mans 24 Hours and the World Sports Car Championship in the same year (the others were the Ferrari 375 Plus in 1954 and the Ferrari 250TR in 1958). It also won the Nurburgring, Le Mans, and Tourist Trophy all in 1959, matching the Ferrari 250TR’s record with its three consecutive wins in 1958.
The DBR1 won six World Sportscar Championships in the ‘50s, which was a record and remained a record until surpassed by the Ferrari 250TR. The car was fixed with a racing version of the Lagonda straight-six engine, in order to comply with the 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations. It was a 2.5-liter engine that clocked 250 hp. In August 2017, a DBR1/1 was sold for $22,555,000, which is a world-record price for a British-made car. Bloomberg has called the DBR1 the “most important Aston Martin ever made.” Only five of these purpose-built cars were ever made, according to the Telegraph.
</p>

<p>The Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa, or TR, is a race car that was built during the 1950s and ‘60s. The car was introduced at the end of the 1957 racing season in preparation of Le Mans and the new regulation that limited sports cars to just 3-liter engines. The 250TR, as you can tell by reading other entries on this list, absolutely dominated the competition when it was racing.
The car has won 10 World Sportscar Championships, three 24 Hours of Le Mans (1958, 1960, 1961), and more. The Aston Martin DBR1 is the only car that came close to beating it (and it did, on four separate occasions).
</p>

<p>
Only 34 Ferrari Testa Rossas were ever built, all of them between 1956 and 1961. “Testa Rossa” meant “red head,” in reference to its paint job. The most famous of these, the 250TR, were all built between 1957 and 1958, with only two factory models and 19 customer models being produced. It’s considered the second-most valuable Ferrari in existence, with valuations upwards of $8 million. Though one car sold at a 2011 auction for $16.4 million, a record at the time. And in 2014, another one sold for $39.8 million—indeed putting it as the second-most valuable Ferrari of all time, right behind our #1 holder…
</p>


<p>
The Ferrari 250 GTO was a race car produced between 1962 and 1964 for the FIA’s Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. The car was powered by a Tipo V12 engine. Only 39 of these cars were made: 33 with the 1962-63 bodywork (Series I), three with the 1964 bodywork (Series II), which was similar to the Ferrari 250 LM, and three “330 GTO” limited edition cars with larger engines. The GTO cost $18,000 at its onset in the United States, and buyers had to be personally approved by Enzo Ferrari and his dealer.
</p>


<p>
This Is How Much The World's Rarest Car Is Worth Today
In 2012, the 1962 GTO made for Stirling Moss set an all-time record-selling price of $38,115,000. Another 250 GTO set the record for the most expensive car ever sold at auction when it fetched a staggering $48,405,000 in 2018. Unofficially, a 1963 Ferrari GTO was also sold to a private owner in 2018, fetching a record-breaking sum of $70 million.
</p>

<p>
Enzo Ferrari once said he thought the Jaguar XKE was “the most beautiful car in the world.” And the 250 GTO kind of looks like one, so we wonder where he got the design idea for the car. It’s been nominated as the top sports car of all time by Sports Car International in 2004, and Motor Trend Classic placed it first on its list of “Greatest Ferraris of All Time.” Popular Mechanics named it the “Hottest Car of All Time.”
