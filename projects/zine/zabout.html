<!-- <h1>ABOUT</h1> -->

 
<!-- <div class="car"> -->

<p>The manufacturers of the cars listed here are well known for their high-performance, high-priced, high-end vehicles. But even companies like Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Bugatti would not have regularly priced cars listed at the exorbitant amounts listed here. No, the cars that are truly the rarest and most expensive are the cars delegated to one-offs, limited editions, special issues, and rare finds.</p>

<p>Cars ... we've had a love and fascination with them ever since they started rolling off the assembly line. Over the years they have evolved from simple machines designed to get us safely to our destination, to becoming statements about who we are, how we want to be seen, and how we view ourselves as a society.</p>

<p>During this time cars have had some radical design changes; some for the better and some for the worse. Here are our top pics for the 60 most distinctive and iconic, classic cars, and while you may not like them all - they are memorable.</p>

<p>Imagine the joy, when you see, drive, or even buy a normal brand new car. The feeling is amazing, right! Well, there are also cars that are exceptional or in other words rare.
These cars are appealing because, based on their unusual circumstances surrounding their productions and their performances, they are unique.</p>
