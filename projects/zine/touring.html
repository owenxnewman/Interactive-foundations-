<h1>1957 Jaguar XKSS</h1>

        <p>The Jaguar XKSS was a road-friendly version of the Jaguar D-Type race car. It was originally built in 1957 and looks somewhat like a precursor to the Jaguar E-Type. Only 16 of these cars were made over 50 years ago, out of a scheduled 25, and the final nine were built and launched in 2016, built to the exact specifications of the originals.
        </p>

        <p>The car came about after a few completed D-Types were unsold following the 1956 racing season. Sir William Lyons of Jaguar decided to convert the cars to be road-legal in an attempt to exploit the American market, which was heavily into high-performance European cars. <span class="special"> “It’s based off of the Jaguar D-Type race car and came about as a result of Jaguar pulling out of competitive motorsports at the time,”</span> said Barazi, a spokesman for CarSumo.
        </p>

        <p>The Jaguar XKSS was popularized by iconic actor Steve McQueen, who bought one for $5,000 in 1958 and was seen driving it around all over Los Angeles. According to Jalopnik, Steven McQueen's XKSS is worth an estimated $30 million, mainly because of who owned it. But if you have one of the original XKSS models, Jalopnik expects you could fetch $1.5 to $1.6 million for it.

<h1>Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale</h1>

  <section class="flex-container">

  <p>The Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale (“stradale” is Italian for “road-going”) was an Italian sports car built between 1967 and 1969. Only 18 of the cars were built. As the name indicates, it is a street-legal version of a racing car, in this case, the Autodelta Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 sports prototype.
  </p>

  <p>The engine produced was a 2.0-liter V8 that featured SPICA fuel injection, four ignition coils, and 16 spark plugs—it was specially built for this car. It gave the Stradale a top speed of 160 mph and a 0-60 time of 5.5 seconds, which wasn’t bad for 1967.</p>

  <p>According to Alfa Romeo, this car’s original launch price was 10 million Italian lire, which was about $6,150 at the time. Estimates for this car now sit at around $3 million and above, and Barazi of CarSumo thinks that, because they so rarely are shown at auction, the price could be much higher than that $3 million estimate.</p>

<h1><h1>954 Oldsmobile F-88</h1>

  <p>The Oldsmobile F-88 was a “dream car” built in 1954, with the initial sketches drawn by Bill Lange. It was built on the chassis of a Chevrolet Corvette and used the same 102-inch wheelbase, and the body was built of fiberglass. The car used a 5.3-liter Super 88 V8 engine with a four-barrel carburetor, giving it up to 250 hp, and a Corvette-derived rear axle. The instrument panel on the car was later used on the Cutlass.
  </p>

  <p>Many people believe that the F-88 was the car that changed the style of cars for the new, upcoming era. In 2005 the car was sold at the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction to John and Maureen Hendricks for $3.24 million, and it’s now on display with its own showroom at the Gateway Colorado Automobile Museum.</p>

  <p>Rumors abound that a second F-88 was built and met a grisly death during a fire between display shows. But those rumors are unfounded. Either way, this is not your typical Oldsmobile, as you can tell by its sleek, golden body and pristine condition. We doubt this thing even got driven around, as who would want to mess up a thing of beauty like this? The F-88 is an example of car manufacturing transcending to art.</p>

<h1><h1>1955 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing</h1>
</h1>

  <section class="flex-container">

  <p>The Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing is a classic, iconic car that is used in many productions and owned by quite a few collectors today. Still, it’s one of the rarest cars in the world, and it fetches a ridiculously high asking price. The 300SL is a grand tourer and the fastest production car of its day. It was built as a toned-down Gran Prix car, tailored to attract the affluent high-performance enthusiasts in post-War America. The car was immediately successful after its debut at the 1954 New York Auto Show. 1,400 coupes and 1,858roadsters were built between 1954 and 1963, for a total of 3,258 cars.
  </p>

  <p>The 300SL was considered “a race car for the street,” as suggested by New York Mercedes’ distributor Max Hoffman. It ran on a 3.0-liter overhead cam straight-six engine that delivered 215 hp (or 240 with optimal variants), and a top speed of 160 mph, making it the fastest production car of its time. As Barazi of CarGurus has said, “The 300SL was the most technologically advanced vehicle to hit the market in the 50s.” And because of that, you’re going to be paying seven figures for one—and even more for an aluminum alloy version. For instance, one aluminum alloy version sold at auction for $4.62 million in 2012, AutoBlog reported.
  </p>

  <p>Mercedes and its successor, Mercedes-Benz, was one of the first foreign car companies to achieve major success in America. By the 1920s, the company’s K and S models were some of the most expensive vehicles on the market, delivered mainly through a New York distributor to some of the wealthiest people in the country, including General Motors magnate Cliff Durant. This four-passenger is a sports tourer was originally sold to vaudeville singing star Al Jolson, who posed with the car and his wife in New York in 1928. He maintained the car until 1947, when he sold it to Brooks Stevens, a young man revered as “The Seer Who Made Milwaukee Famous” (according to Sotheby’s).

<h1>Bugatti Type 41 Royale Kellner Coupe </h1>

  <section class="flex-container">

  <p>Before Bugatti was known for their high-end, high-priced supercars, they were known for their luxury vehicles. The Type 41, better known as the Royale, was a large luxury car built between 1927 and 1933. It weight approximately 7,000 pounds (which is a lot), and used a 12.763-liter straight-eight engine (which is huge). For comparison, a modern Rolls-Royce Phantom is 20% shorter and 25% lighter than the Bugatti Type 41. In fact, the Type 41 is one of the largest cars in the world—and unofficially, it’s one of the most stylish.
  </p>

  <p>Ettore Bugatti planned to build 25 of these cars and to sell them to royalty as “the most luxurious car ever,” but you’ll note that the cars were built during the Great Depression, so his timing was a bit off….</p>

  <p>Not even European royalty was buying cars such as this during that time, so only three of the seven made were sold. The chassis alone cost $30,000 to build when it was first made. Today, six of the cars exist, and one of them was destroyed in a wreck. In 2001, Forbes reported the price-tag of this car at $10 million, though CarBuzz reported in 1987 that one had sold at auction for $9.7 million.

<h1>1953 Jaguar XK120-C</h1>

  <section class="flex-container">

<p>The Jaguar XK120-C, or the C-Type, was a racing sports car from Jaguar produced between 1951 and 1953. The car was built using a lightweight tubular frame and an aerodynamic body developed by Heynes, RJ Knight, and Malcolm Sayer. Only 53 of these cars were built, and 43 of them were sold to private owners, making it possibly the rarest Jaguar in the world. One thing is certain: When a ’53 C-Type sold at an RM Auction in Italy in 2015 for $13.2 million, it became the most expensive Jaguar ever sold.
</p>

<p>The road-version car ran on a 3.4-liter twin-cam straight-six engine that produced between 160 and 180 bhp, while the track-version had a 205 bhp tuned engine. The C-Type was very successful at racing, proven by its two wins at the Le Mans 24 Hours race, first in 1951, and then in 1953. They lost in 1952 because Jaguar was worried about the reported speed of the new Mercedes-Benz 300SLs, so they modified the aerodynamics to increase speed, but the rearrangement led to overheating from a vulnerable cooling system.

<h1>1962 Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato </h1>

  <section class="flex-container">

<p>The Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato was unveiled at the 1960 London Motor Show as a lightened, improved version of the standard DB4 GT. It was improved at the Zagato factory in Italy, where the car was expected to have a run of 25 units, but ended up ceasing production on the 20th. The car has a popular history, which has resulted in two subsequent cars being named “Zagatos,” both based on the DB4. Zagato is one of the world’s most well-known coachbuilders. They’ve been around since 1919 and have designed some of the most memorable cars, including this one.
</p>

<p>The car was powered by a 3.7-liter twin-spark straight-six engine that produced 314 hp, had a 0-60 acceleration time of 6.1 seconds, and a top speed of 154 mph. All of the steel components of the DB4 were replaced on this car with aluminum, making it smaller, more aerodynamic, and 100 pounds lighter. One of the originals recently sold at auction for $14.3 million.

  <section class="flex-container">

<p>This beautiful car probably looks a bit familiar to a few readers, and that’s because a Ferrari 250 GT was the same car that was used in the ‘80s blockbuster, “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” “Only 55 of these cars were ever made, making it one of the most sought-after Ferraris on the market,” says Shayrgo Bazari of CarSumo. The Ferrari 250 GT was built between 1953 and 1964, with many racing models built in between those years.
</p>

<p>No One Knew These Movie Cars Were Totally Fake
The car featured in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off was a replica, fiberglass-bodied version of the 250 GT Spyder California. A 1961 SWB was sold by James Coburn to radio DJ Chris Evans for £5.5 million. Another ’61 SWB, a barn find that was used in the film “Les Felins” with Jane Fonda, sold for $15.9 million in 2015. And finally, on March 11, 2016, at the Omni Amelia Island Plantation, a ’61 SWB was auctioned off for $17.16 million.
